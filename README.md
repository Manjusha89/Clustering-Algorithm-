KMeans clustering partitions the data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
Suitability for Iris dataset: KMeans is suitable for Iris dataset because:
. Iris dataset has continuous features.
. KMeans is effective for datasets with compact, spherical clusters.
Hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) by iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on a distance metric. It is useful for visualizing the hierarchy of clusters and does not require specifying the number of clusters initially.
In conclusion, this assignment demonstrated the application of clustering techniques to the Iris dataset using KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms. The results showed that both algorithms successfully identified distinct clusters within the data, highlighting the inherent structure of the Iris dataset. KMeans clustering proved effective in identifying compact clusters, while Hierarchical clustering revealed nested relationships between clusters. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate clustering algorithms based on dataset characteristics and research objectives. Overall, this exercise provided valuable insights into the utility of clustering techniques in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships within complex datasets."
